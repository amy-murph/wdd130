<h2>Amy Murph</h2>
<p>I'm Amy! I was born and raised in Reno, Nevada - also known as the "biggest 
little city in the world". I am majoring in art with an emphasis in Graphic Design! 
Some things that I love to do whenever I have the time is traveling and seeing new things,
going different places, snowboarding, paddle boarding, hanging out with freinds, and swimming
at my favorite lakes back home!</p>
<p>The thing I love most about BYU-I is the feeling here on campus. Living in a place where I can 
be in nature but also be surrounded by people who have the same intrests is something you 
can't beat. I am pursuing my degree of graphic design and it has been so fun!</p>
<p>I think learning about web design can be so useful because I think our world is getting more 
and more reliant with online experiences. I hope to be able to use my passion for design to help
create a website for people who want it!</p>
<p>I have been blessed to be born into the church! One of my favorite scriptures is in 1 Nephi 19:9
   
    "And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they 
    scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they aspit upon him, 
    and he suffereth it, because of his loving bkindness and his clong-suffering towards the children of men."</p>
