            <h4>About me - Its important to know what you like and what's 
                best for your pre-designed branding. On this page i have 
                included some things that I have created so you can see what 
                you like and what styles you think could draw in your audience. 
                I love my neutrals with a pop of color that adds a fun vibe to 
                whatever i'm creating! I love putting colors together and choosing 
                the perfect type face to fit the message!</h4>
