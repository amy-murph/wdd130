                <p>The Coeur d'Alene River extends up from Coeur dâ€™Alene Lake 
                    east to Kingston, where it branches into the North Fork,  
                    stretching almost to Lake Pend Oreille, and the South Fork 
                    that flows east from almost the Montana border. Flowing 
                    through historic mining areas of the Silver Valley past 
                    numerous communities, it is a superb recreational river for 
                    numerous pursuits, from easy whitewater to paddling and, 
                    particularly in upstream stretches, fishing. </p>

                <p> Known as "The River of No Return," the Salmon River 
                    originates in the Sawtooth and Lemhi Valleys of central
                     and eastern Idaho; snows from the Sawtooth and Salmon 
                     River Mountains in the south and the Clearwater and Bitterroot
                     Mountains in the north feed this river. The upper section 
                     passes through the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness,
                     while the lower section forms the southern boundary of the 
                     Gospel-Hump Wilderness. In recognition of the river's many
                     outstanding values, including scenery, recreation, geology, 
                     fish, wildlife, water quality, botany, prehistory, history and
                     cultural traditional use, Congress designated 46 miles of the
                     river, from North Fork to Corn Creek, as a recreational river
                     and 79 miles, from Corn Creek to Long Tom Bar, as a wild river.</p>

                    <p> The Selway River is a large tributary of the Middle Fork of 
                        the Clearwater River in the U.S. state of Idaho. It flows within 
                        the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, the Bitterroot National Forest, 
                        and the Nez Perce National Forest of North Central Idaho.[5] The 
                        entire length of the Selway was included by the United States Congress 
                        in 1968 as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.</p>
